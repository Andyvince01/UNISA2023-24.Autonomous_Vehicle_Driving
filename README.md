# üöó UNISA2023-24.Autonomous_Vehicle_Driving

In the context of this university project, we focused on **developing and improving an autonomous driving agent** using the `CARLA` simulator. The project began with a basic agent that had limited navigation capabilities. Initially, this agent could only follow a predetermined path and perform simple actions such as braking in the presence of pedestrians, traffic lights, and vehicles. However, it struggled with more complex situations, often colliding with obstacles and failing when faced with scenarios requiring different decision-making.

## üß† **Enhanced Driving Logic**

To address these limitations, we utilized the information provided by CARLA to perceive the environment and developed numerous advanced driving logics. These logics were designed to handle various challenges present in the different scenarios provided by the simulator. Our goal was to enhance the basic agent by equipping it with advanced driving capabilities to manage complex situations that the basic agent could not handle. 

## üö¶ **Advanced Scenarios**

The improvements included the ability to:
- **Deal with bicycles**: Implementing logic to safely navigate around bicycles.
- **Overtake parked vehicles**: Developing strategies to maneuver around stationary obstacles.
- **Handle intersections**: Creating decision-making processes for navigating complex road junctions.
- **React to road cones**: Adding functionality to adjust driving behavior in response to road obstacles and construction elements.

These enhancements aimed to produce a more robust and versatile agent, capable of handling a wide range of road scenarios with safe driving behaviors within the project‚Äôs domain

## üõ†Ô∏è **Results and Impact**

The result of this development was a significantly improved autonomous driving agent. This enhanced agent demonstrated a higher level of robustness and versatility, being able to safely and effectively manage a variety of road scenarios that went beyond the capabilities of the initial basic agent. The improvements not only addressed the agent‚Äôs shortcomings but also expanded its operational scope, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

## üèÜ **Conclusion**

The project successfully transformed a basic autonomous driving agent into a sophisticated system capable of managing complex driving scenarios. By leveraging CARLA's environmental information and implementing advanced driving logic, we achieved a substantial enhancement in the agent‚Äôs performance, demonstrating its ability to navigate diverse road situations with greater safety and efficiency.
